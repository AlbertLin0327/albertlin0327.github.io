I'm Albert, a CS & Finance double major undergrad who relishes a challenge.

## Education

I started my [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) college life in 2019 Sep. I double-majored in **Computer Science** (B.S) and **Finance** (B.B.A). In 2021, I decided to join the Creativity and Entrepreneurship Program and try out new possibilities in life.

I am also a student researcher. I joined professor _Hsuan-Tien Lin's_ [**CLLab** (Computational Learning Lab)](https://learner.csie.ntu.edu.tw/doku.php) and researched time-series data deep learning. Also, I joined professor _Shih-wei Liao's_ [**ABCLAB**](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~liao/) and researched Blockchain technology.

## Autobiography

I am always enthusiastic for life, no matter the hardship I face. I was the school basketball team lead in high school. I worked out everyday and trained a lot to help my team. My experience in the school team has allowed me to persevere and overcome the challenge in front of me.

Later on, I entered college as a CS freshman. I am extremely lucky to meet my enthusiasm in such early life. I enjoy programming and building software with my hand. Also, I have cultivated different interests including Finance. I started to find learning satisfying. I believe that all the learning and altitude will aid me in achieving something great in the future.

Beside the hard skills built up by books and practice, I have some experience in working in different groups and learn to cooperate with people from different disciplines. I have learned to fit in a group with lots of different idea, and also learn to become a good leader of the group. All these past experiences have made me into a self-disciplined and self-motivated person.

Lastly, I would like to end this section with the life motto of one of my favorite basketball stars Kyrie Irving. **Hungry and Humble** -- always stay motivated and aim for higher; also stay humble and learn from other at the same time. Life is full of unknown and surprise. Prepare myself and be ready for the challenge tomorrow.
